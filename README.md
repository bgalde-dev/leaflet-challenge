UCSD Leaflet Challenge

## Goal 
The goal was to create a Leaflet map of the recent earthquakes recorded by the USGS utizing the USGS API for
earthquake data. The Relative size of each marker is representative of relative magnitude. Not true magnitude 
as the Richter scale is logorithmic and would wash out a useful visualization. The color of each marker is based 
on the depth of each earthquake as given by the legend.

The data if for the past week per the API at [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

## Steps

Step 1 was just to map the eatrthquakes for the past week. Can be found [HERE](leaflet-step-1/index.html)
Step 2 was to map the eatrthquakes and tectonic plates. Can be found [HERE](leaflet-step-2/index.html)
